# BathroomCholla
my bathroom cholla light: it's a piece of dried out cholla cactus with two WS2811 "pixel modules" inside. the inspiration for this project was sunlight through aspens... I wanted a gently flickering green/yellow light with a "natural" progression of colors & flicker times. to that end, this project makes heavy use of the random() function & FastLED color palette blending.
